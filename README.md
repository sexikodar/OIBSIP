# OIBSIP – Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains Data Science projects/tasks completed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte** as a Data Science Intern. Each task is organized with its dataset (CSV file) and a corresponding Jupyter Notebook documenting the solution and analysis.




## About

This repository showcases 5 Data Science projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.




## Tasks Overview

**Task 1:**
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according totheir species, and thus the task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from themeasurements of the iris species and classify them.

**Task 2:** 
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have witnessed a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so I've analyzed the unemployment rate.

**Task 3:** 
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning domain.

**Task 4:** 
We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project,I've used Python to build an email spam detector. Then, have used machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

**Task 5:** 
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So this task by me concludes the sales prediction with machine learning using Python.




## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sexikodar/OIBSIP.git
    cd OIBSIP
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files for each task in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VSCode, Google Colab).




## Usage

- Open any task folder.
- Load the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to see the analysis and results.
- Make sure the CSV file is in the same directory as the notebook.
